# Weather Prediction With Python And Machine Learning

## URL :https://vidhyasivanpandi.github.io/weatherprediction/


Predicting weather using machine learning in Python can be a complex task, as it involves dealing with vast amounts of data, including historical weather data, satellite images, and more. Here's a simplified outline of the steps you can follow to create a basic weather prediction model using Python and machine learning:

Data Collection:

Gather historical weather data from reliable sources such as government agencies, meteorological organizations, or APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
Feature engineering: Create relevant features like temperature trends, humidity levels, wind speed, and more.
Split the data into training and testing datasets.
Feature Selection and Scaling:

Choose the most relevant features for your model.
Scale or normalize the features to ensure that they are on a similar scale.
Model Selection:

Choose a machine learning algorithm suitable for your problem. For weather prediction, you can start with regression models (e.g., Linear Regression), time series models (e.g., ARIMA), or more advanced techniques like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
Model Training:

Train your chosen model on the training dataset.
Tune hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate your model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction:

Use your trained model to make weather predictions for future dates.
Visualization:

Create visualizations to represent your predictions and make them easy to understand.
Deployment (optional):

If you plan to deploy your weather prediction model for real-time predictions, consider integrating it into a web application or providing an API.

## EXAMPLE:-

#### Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

#### Load your weather dataset
data = pd.read_csv('weather_data.csv')

#### Preprocess data, select features, and split into train and test sets
#### ...

#### Create and train a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#### Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

#### Evaluate the model's performance
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')

#### Use the trained model to predict future weather
